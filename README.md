# butterflies motion datasets

we created and release a first-of-its-kind, publicly available motion capture dataset of a swallow-tail butterfly (Papilio polytes) to research community. Complete long-distance or long-duration flight data, including 18 flight segments from 5 different butterflies, of free-flying swallowtail butterflies.


## Our method
Figure 1 show examples of motion-captured trajectories of the thorax and wings of a flying butterfly by our method.

## Comparison
Comparisons between our method and existing methods. The wiped data (green dashed) denotes a randomly selected portion of the ground-truth data that is intentionally removed for this comparison purpose.
